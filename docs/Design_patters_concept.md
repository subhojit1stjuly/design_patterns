# Design Patterns

## What are Design Patterns?

Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. 
They are like blueprints that can be customized to solve recurring design problems in your code.

## Understanding Design Patterns

### Not Just Copy-Paste Solutions
Design patterns are not ready-made pieces of code that can be directly copied into your program. 
Unlike packages or plugins in the Flutter ecosystem, design patterns are general concepts that 
provide approaches to solve particular problems.

### Design Patterns vs Algorithms

While both design patterns and algorithms describe solutions to problems, they differ in several ways:

| Design Patterns | Algorithms |
|----------------|------------|
| High-level solution description | Clear set of instructions |
| Flexible implementation | Specific implementation steps |
| Same pattern can have different implementations | Fixed sequence of steps |

#### Analogy
- **Algorithms** are like cooking recipes with predetermined steps
- **Design Patterns** are like architectural blueprints that show the result but leave the implementation details to you

## Structure of Design Pattern Documentation

Every design pattern is typically documented with these key sections:

1. **Intent**
   - Brief description of the problem
   - Overview of the solution

2. **Motivation**
   - Detailed problem explanation
   - How the pattern solves it

3. **Structure**
   - Class diagrams
   - Relationships between components

4. **Code Example**
   - Implementation examples in popular programming languages

### Additional Information

Some patterns may include:
- Implementation details
- Applicability guidelines
- Relations with other patterns
- Usage examples

## Best Practices

- Understand the problem before applying a pattern
- Don't force patterns where they're not needed
- Consider the context and requirements
- Focus on maintainability and flexibility

## Types of Design Patterns

Design patterns can be categorized into three main types:

### 1. Creational Design Patterns
These types of design patterns solve object creation related design problems. They provide solutions for creating objects in a manner suitable to the situation, abstracting the instantiation process.

### 2. Structural Design Patterns
These types of design patterns solve the relationship between objects. They help ensure that different parts of an application work together seamlessly and define how objects and classes can be composed to form larger structures.

### 3. Behavioral Design Patterns
These types of design patterns solve how objects should communicate with each other. They identify common communication patterns between objects and provide solutions for effective interaction and responsibility distribution between objects.
